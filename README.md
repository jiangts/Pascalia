Exploring Catalan-like numbers through the lens of Pascal's relation

----

See it [in action](http://jiangts.github.com/Pascalia).

###Usage
To use, click on the "Setup" button and enter the top row of "Pascal's Matrix" in the following format:
```
[<index1>, <value1>], [<index2>, <value2>], ...
```
Note that indexes cannot repeat. 

The example shown below is generated by
```
[0, 1], [-1, -1]
```
which yields the famous [Catalan Numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number).
